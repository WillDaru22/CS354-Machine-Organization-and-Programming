# CS354-Machine-Organization-and-Programming
Courses from a course in 2019 on fundamental structures of computer systems and the C programming language with a focus on the low-level interrelationships and impacts on performance.  

Topics covered included the virtual address space and virtual memory, the heap and dynamic memory management, the memory hierarchy and caching, assembly language and the stack, communication and interrupts/signals, compiling and assemblers/linkers.  

Code for these is a mix of instructor code and my own code for purposes of learning and creating projects as this is coursework.  Some projects were not included due to copyright desires from the instructors who wrote the original program template that was to be filled in and improved on during the course.
